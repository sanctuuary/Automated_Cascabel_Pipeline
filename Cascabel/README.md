# Tool annotations

- `toolAnnotationsOriginal`: The original tool annotations, generated from bio.tools.
- `toolAnnotationsSupplemented`: The original tool annotations with added information from this project's README.
- `toolAnnotationsReference`: The supplemented tool annotations, adjusted based on a reference workflow.

The `toolAnnotationsReference` currently does not have the Fasttree and RAxML tools, as they are incomplete and were causing issues.
