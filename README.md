# Automated composition of the Cascabel Pipeline

Cascabel (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.489357) is a variable pipeline for amplicon sequence data analysis.

It makes an interesting use case for workflow work with bio.tools/EDAM and APE, as it already foresees several variants of the main workflow, and potentially more can be found when taking to account the full content of bio.tools.
